## Kinematics
- **Forward Kinematics (FK)** - Computing an end-effector pose from joint angles, visualising reachable workspace, and implementing an efficient single-pass FK algorithm for arbitrary chains.
- **Differential Kinematics** - Deriving the Jacobian matirix, interpreting its geometric meaning, plotting the manipulability ellipse, and detecting singularities via rank/condition tests.
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** - Solving the pose-to-joint problem through both analytic and numerical techniques.
